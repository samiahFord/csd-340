      <h2>A Beautiful Day - Francis Duggan</h2>
      <p>
        In the <span id="blue">______</span> sky just a few specks of gray<br />
        In the evening of a beautiful day<br />
        Though last night it rained and more rain on the way<br />
        And that more rain is needed 'twould be fair to say
      </p>
      <p>
        On a <span id="gum">______</span> tree in the park the white backed
        magpie sing<br />
        He sings all year round from the Summer to Spring<br />
        But in late Winter and Spring he even sings at night<br />
        So nice to hear him piping in the moonlight
      </p>
      <p>
        Spring it is with us and Summer is near<br />
        And <span id="beautiful">______</span> weather for the time of year<br />
        Such beauty the poets and the artists inspire<br />
        Of talking of Nature could one ever tire<br />
        Her green of <span id="September">______</span> Mother Nature wear<br />
        And the perfumes of blossoms in the evening air.
