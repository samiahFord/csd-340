        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="intro"><span class="sentence">My name is Samiah and I'm from a city in South Dakota called Sioux Falls!</span> 
                 I was born there when the city was relatively small
                but it has grown quite a bit in population and size within the last decade or so. I grew up visiting neighboring farms where I
                learned to take care of chickens and goats!</p>
            <p>South Dakota has some harsh seasons! When it is too hot or too cold to enjoy the outdoors, I like to read, crochet
                , and play video games on my PC. When the weather is habitable, I like to go on long walks and ride bikes.</p>
            <p>I also love to spend time with my family! We often get together for dinners or game nights and just like to hang out with each
                other. I especially love spending time with my little nephew!</p>
            <p>A major part of my family is my furbabies! I have a chihuahua dachshund mix named Juno and a miniature dachshund named Honey.
                They are both full of life and spirit and <I>VERY</I> loud.</p>
